Welcome, welcome [USER NAME]! You’re just in time for tonight’s story: Astraea by Dusk Dawning. 
Our tale begins in a cottage on the outskirts of the small village Orion, way up in the attic…
There lived a young girl by the name of Atlas. To all the villagers, she was the perfect daughter of the best chief in Orion history; polite, intelligent, graceful, and quiet; but little did they know her façade would slip off the moment she stepped foot back into the place she had to call home. 
Though a poised lady on the surface, she could not have been more different. She was rebellious and imaginative, spirited and loud in an explosive childlike way. Unfo(u)rtunately for our poor Atlas, this version of her was but a distant daydream, something that she could never become beyond her imagination. Why do you think that is?

…
…them. Her dreadful parents who loved her to bits. 
She organized her backpack, taking out the homework essentials and cuddling Sol, her deer plush, before climbing up the stairs to the attic with it. 
The attic was a safe space for her; away from the toxins of a forcèd family. After starting her grandmother’s jukebox, she set up a table next to a window and started completing her homework, humming along to the songs, gripping tightly to Sol, until she fell fast asleep. 
The sky outside was dark. Atlas rushed down the stairs, clutching onto Sol for dear life, yet strangely, there was nothing. 
She peered over the kitchen sink where the broken glass lay. She looked up. Broken window. The culprit? A strange creature that appeared to be a cat with wings sitting on a tree that spawned in her side yard. 
Atlas left the house and headed slowly towards where the creature was. Its eyes glowed a vibrant blue against the neon hue of Orion. 
The creature jumped out of the tree, racing in the direction of the forest Orion named the “Forest of Disasters”. You would think Atlas thought a bit before dashing right in but clearly she didn’t. 
The creature had disappeared into the woods but it left a trail behind it. 
She followed the trail to a clearing where there was a small arch. She walked closer, feeling her fingers against the cold wet stones it was made of. Beside it lay an adorable pink music box. 
She picked up the box, pressing her fingers lightly against it until she heard a “click”! A key popped out of the drawer on the box. Atlas picked up the key and gently placed it on the back of the box, winding the toy up. 
With a gentle whoosh the stone arch turned into a swirly portal with a pastel light. The music from the box was playing gently as if asking her to walk through before time was up. What do you think happens after, dear [USER NAME]?

She jumps in like there’s no tomorrow! I would assume she did so just to satiate her own curiosity, but her parents do seem to be a big part of her decision as well. Anyways, let’s continue on with the story…
As she lay down, she stared at the sky above with a beautiful pink and purple hue. Her head was dizzy, probably from all the spinning and as she sat up she noticed two very strange things…
She had landed on top of a strange animal wearing a green suit. They seemed to have been drinking some sort of crimson fluid that spilled all over their clothes and the glass it appeared to be from had shattered all over the floor. 
Atlas practically flung herself backwards. Squatting beside her was a young girl with brown hair and… deer antlers? 
Sol closed her eyes as a glowing crown of light formed from her forehead. She reached out in front of her, opened her eyes sharply, and tapped lightly, sending a thin beam of light shooting through the air like a rocket. 
Sol grabs Atlas by the arm and pulls her through the stone gate, dragging her along as they head towards the buildings in the distance.
